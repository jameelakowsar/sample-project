 * 5. Here, As I don't have multiple API's to his on different navlinks, I had taken same API with different pages and diferent data.
 * 6. In Summary Page, Based on data, shown every single country details on individual card.
 * 7. Given 'delete' option on card, by clicking on this, that card will be deleted from store and UI.
 * Note: Refreshing the page will add that card again, as I am not changing any API data. Just managing store. -- present delete button is not working
